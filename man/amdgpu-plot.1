.SH NAME
amdgpu-plot \- continuously update and plot critical GPU parameters as a function of time

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B amdgpu-plot
.RB [ \-\-help " | " \-\-about "]"
.br
.B amdgpu-plot
.RB [ \-\-no_fan "] [" \-\-stdin "] [" \-\-simlog "] [" \-\-ltz "] [" \-\-sleep " \fIN\fP] [" \-\-debug "]

.SH CONFIGURATION
All amdgpu-utils require that compatible GPU cards and drivers are installed and that
the feature to access them is enabled.  This can be accomplished by adding
amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT value in
/etc/default/grub and executing update-grub.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B amdgpu-plot
will continuously plot a trend of critical GPU parameters for all compatible AMD GPUs.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR " \-\-about"
Will display details about
.B amdgpu-plot\fP.
.TP
.BR " \-\-ltz"
Use local time zone instead of UTC for displays and logging.
.TP
.BR " \-\-no_fan"
Will exclude fan information from the display.  Useful with watercooled GPUs.
.TP
.BR " \-\-stdin"
Will read data from stdin.  This is useful to display plots of a logfile save with \fBamdgpu-monitor\fR.
.TP
.BR " \-\-simlog"
When used with the \-\-stdin option, it will simulate the reading of data from the logfile at a rate
define by \fB\-\-sleep\fR.
.TP
.BR " \-\-sleep " \fIN\fP
Specifies N, the number of seconds to sleep between updates.
.TP
.BR " \-\-debug"
Will display additional details useful in troubleshooting.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display help text and exit.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.nf
.B amdgpu-plot \-\-sleep 5 \-\-ltz

.fi
Will open a Gtk window that will display plots of operation parameters for all compatible AMD GPU's that
every 5s.  Time stamps displayed will use local time zone.
.P
.B cat \fIlogfile\fR | \fBamdgpu-plot \-\-stdin \-\-simlog \-\-sleep 1

.fi
Will open a Gtk window that will display plots of the GPU operation data in the specified \fIlogfile\fR
to simulate streamed data with a 1 sec interval.
.P

.SH "FILES"
.PP
.TP
\fB/usr/share/ricks-amdgpu-utils/amd_pci_id.txt\fR
A list of all known AMD PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses).
.TP
\fB~/.amdgpu-utils/amd_pci_id.txt\fR
A locally updated list of all known AMD PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses). This is produced
with the \fBamdgpu-pciid --install\fR command and if it exists, is used instead if the /usr/share version.
.TP
\fB/sys/class/drm/card*/device/pp_od_clk_voltage\fR
Special driver file for each GPU required for \fBamdgpu-utils\fR.
.TP
\fB/etc/default/grub\fR
The grub defaults file where amdgpu.ppfeaturemask needs to be set.

.SH BUGS
Known to not work well with Fiji ProDuo cards and will issue warning messages for Fiji Nano cards.
